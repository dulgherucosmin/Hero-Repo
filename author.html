        <h2><span class="underline">R.F. Kuang's Life</span></h2>
        <p>
            Rebecca F. Kuang, commonly known as R.F. Kuang, is a Chinese-American writer and scholar. Born on May 29, 1996,
            in Guangzhou, China, she immigrated to the United States with her family when she was four years old. She
            grew up in Dallas, Texas, where she developed a deep passion for history, literature, and languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kuang’s interest in storytelling and historical narratives was shaped by her early exposure to both Western
            and Chinese literature. As she grew older, she became particularly fascinated by the lasting effects of war,
            colonialism, and cultural identity—topics that would later define much of her academic and professional work.

            Beyond her literary career, Kuang has made significant contributions as a scholar and translator. Her deep
            engagement with historical research and language studies has influenced both her writing and her academic pursuits.

        <p>
            Kuang attended Georgetown University, where she studied History, focusing on Chinese studies and 20th-century
            conflicts. Her research delved into topics such as the Sino-Japanese War and the legacy of colonialism in
            East Asia. She also spent time studying abroad in Beijing and Cambridge, further expanding her expertise in
            Chinese history and language.

        </p>
        <p>
            After completing her undergraduate degree, Kuang pursued further education at some of the world’s most prestigious
            institutions. She earned a Master’s in Chinese Studies from the University of Cambridge and later completed
            another Master’s in Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Oxford. Her academic work explored themes of
            linguistic imperialism, translation studies, and historical memory.

        </p>
        <p>
            Continuing her scholarly journey, Kuang later enrolled in a PhD program in East Asian Languages and Literatures
            at Yale University. Her research in this field continues to build upon her deep knowledge of historical narratives,
            language politics, and the power of storytelling.

            Kuang’s academic background plays a major role in shaping her perspectives, making her not only a celebrated
            author but also a respected scholar in historical and literary studies.
