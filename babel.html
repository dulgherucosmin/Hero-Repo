                <p>Babel is a historical fantasy novel that explores the power of language, colonialism, and resistance. Set in an alternate 19th-century Britain, the story follows Robin Swift, an orphan from Canton who is brought to England to train at Oxford University’s prestigious Royal Institute of Translation—known as Babel. In this world, translation is not just a scholarly pursuit but a source of magical power, where silver-work infused with linguistic meaning fuels the British Empire’s expansion and control.

                    As Robin immerses himself in the study of languages and translation, he begins to see the dark reality beneath Babel’s scholarly prestige. The very magic that allows scholars to reshape the world is also a tool of imperial domination, used to uphold systems of power and exploitation. Torn between loyalty to the institution that has given him everything and the growing awareness of its role in oppression, Robin must decide where he stands—and what he is willing to sacrifice for justice.

                    Blending historical fiction with fantasy, Babel is a thought-provoking and intricately crafted novel that challenges ideas of language, power, and rebellion. Kuang masterfully examines how translation shapes our understanding of history and culture while exposing the ways in which language can be weaponized for control. Through its richly detailed world, complex characters, and deeply philosophical themes, Babel is both an academic and emotional journey—one that questions the cost of knowledge, the morality of empire, and the necessity of resistance. A sweeping, ambitious novel, forcing readers to reconsider the true power of words.
