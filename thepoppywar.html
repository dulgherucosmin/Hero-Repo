                <p>The Poppy War is a dark and intense epic fantasy novel inspired by 20th-century Chinese history, particularly
                    the Second Sino-Japanese War. The story follows Rin, a war orphan from a poor province who defies all expectations
                    by earning a place at the prestigious Sinegard Academy, the most elite military school in the empire.
                    Among the children of nobility, she struggles to prove herself while uncovering hidden talents that set her
                    apart from her peers. As she trains in strategy, combat, and arcane lore, she begins to understand that the
                    world is far more dangerous—and magic more real—than she ever imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the academy, tensions between the Nikara Empire and its long-time enemy, the Federation of Mugen, threaten
                    erupt into full-scale war. As Rin is drawn deeper into the complexities of military strategy and politics,
                    she must decide how far she is willing to go to protect her people. In her search for power, she comes face-to-face
                    with the gods of her world—beings that may grant extraordinary abilities but at an unimaginable cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blending historical influences with rich worldbuilding, The Poppy War is a gripping tale of ambition, destiny,
                    and the horrors of war. It challenges the boundaries of fantasy storytelling by weaving real-world history with
                    mythology, creating a novel that is as thought-provoking as it is thrilling. The book is the first in a critically
                    acclaimed trilogy that explores the sacrifices made in the pursuit of power and the weight of history on those who
                    seek to change it.

                    The Dragon Republic is the explosive sequel to The Poppy War, continuing Rin’s journey as she grapples with
                    the aftermath of war and the weight of her own power. Struggling with the consequences of her choices, she
                    finds herself caught between rival factions vying for control of the Nikara Empire. When an ambitious warlord
                    offers her the chance to help create a new, more just republic, Rin is faced with a new battlefield—one of
                    politics, shifting alliances, and betrayals.

                <p>
                    As civil war threatens to tear the empire apart, Rin must navigate treacherous waters where old enemies become
                    unexpected allies, and former friends may no longer be trusted. At the same time, she battles the volatile
                    forces within herself, testing the limits of her abilities and her own sense of morality. The fight for the
                    future of Nikara is not just one of strategy and conquest but also of ideology—forcing Rin to question what
                    kind of leader she truly wants to be.

                <p>
                    With its intense action, political intrigue, and deep emotional stakes, The Dragon Republic expands the world
                    of The Poppy War into a sweeping tale of revolution, revenge, and the cost of power. It is a gripping continuation
                    that explores the price of war and the burden of leadership, pushing Rin further into a destiny she may not
                    be able to escape.

                    In The Burning God, the epic conclusion to The Poppy War trilogy, Rin faces her greatest challenges yet as
                    she returns to a country ravaged by war. With the empire in chaos and foreign invaders threatening to reshape
                    the land, she must harness every ounce of strength and strategy to fight for the future of Nikara. But as enemies
                    close in from all sides, she realizes that winning a war is not the same as securing peace—and that the greatest
                    threats may not come from foreign powers but from within.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rin’s journey is one of vengeance, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of power. As she rises to command
                    armies and shape the fate of her people, she is forced to make choices that will define not only her legacy
                    but the very future of the empire. Her struggle is no longer just against external forces but against the very
                    forces of history, ideology, and the gods themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brutal, heart-wrenching, and thought-provoking, The Burning God delivers an unforgettable finale that solidifies
                    The Poppy War trilogy as one of the most powerful and daring fantasy series of its time. It is a story of ambition
                    and sacrifice, of war and destiny, culminating in a conclusion that is as devastating as it is inevitable.
