                <p>Yellowface is a gripping psychological drama and literary satire that explores themes of ambition,
                    identity, and cultural appropriation in the publishing industry. The novel follows June Hayward, a
                    struggling writer who has watched her former classmate, Athena Liu, rise to literary stardom. When
                    a sudden and tragic event leaves Athena’s latest manuscript unpublished, June makes a fateful decision—she
                    takes the work for herself, rebrands as Juniper Song, and presents the novel as her own.

                    As June’s stolen book becomes a sensation, she finds herself navigating the literary world’s complexities,
                    from the pressures of marketing and social media to the scrutiny of those who suspect the truth. But with
                    every success comes the growing weight of deception, and as questions about her authenticity mount,
                    June is forced to confront the consequences of her choices. How far can she go before the truth catches up with her?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sharp, darkly comedic, and deeply unsettling, Yellowface is both a psychological thriller and a searing
                    critique of the publishing industry’s treatment of race, authorship, and privilege. Kuang delivers a
                    and compulsively readable novel that forces readers to question who gets to tell stories—and at what
                    cost. Through its razor-sharp prose and morally complex characters, Yellowface examines the fine line
                    admiration and exploitation, the hunger for success in a cutthroat industry, and the uncomfortable
                    realities of power dynamics in storytelling. It is a timely and thought-provoking novel that lingers
                    long after the final page.
